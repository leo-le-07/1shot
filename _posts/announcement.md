Next week, start on 21 Dec 2020, I'll change the minimum investment funds to **$150** instead of $100 as current. It's inevitable when my strategy provider supports more copiers, and the total copying capital is bigger.

I believe it makes sense to all my copiers from the beginning with more than 150% profits who have the balance is much more than $150. It's still ok for my recent copiers if your funds are less than $150, but I strongly recommend adding a bit of fund to meet the minimum requirement.

P/s: We make 5.68% of profits today, my friends. Keep it up! üòç
